_This post provides context for [justinwalz/microk8s-vagrant](https://github.com/justinwalz/microk8s-vagrant)._

At work, we use [AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) to manage our [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) clusters. So when it came time to deploy my hobby project, I couldn’t imagine going back to anything else.

Yes. I think Kubernetes is that convenient. Furthermore, it's easier cognitively to use a similar enough stack at work and home.

To be clear, in the past, I’ve used a wide spectrum of methods. I've done the dead simple SSH + clone + run. I've wrapped it that in [ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible). I've transitioned by ansible scripts to build and run [docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers. At work, we've used [Nomad](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad) to schedule our containers. Now using Kubernetes I feel that I cannot go back to any other way. Queue dramatic music... well... I mean, I could. Sometimes it makes sense to do something else. Yada yada yada. But for now, Kubernetes is the way.

However, looking at EKS, the cost was about $75 a month just for the control plane. Too much for a hobby setup.

So I looked at [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops). Then [kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/). Both of which I’ve used at work. Both seemed like overkill.

Then I saw [microk8s](https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s). Boom. It looked lovely, and promising. Built by canonical, they advertise running Kubernetes on a Raspberry Pi? Alright, it can definitely run on my t3 instance.

So here we are. Setting up microk8s for my personal account.

Before we rack up any cloud charges though, let’s use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to test this out. My laptop runs [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) (happily, thanks to the influence of my coworkers), so this provides a pain free way to get a clean Ubuntu install.

_Is this guide out of date? Does something require an extra hint? Let me know by replying to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/justinooowalz/status/1381368104387665920)! Furthermore, errors and omissions are my own. I followed [this guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-a-local-kubernetes-with-microk8s#2-deploying-microk8s) for a local microk8s deployment._

## Vagrant

Let's keep it simple. I assume familiarity with Vagrant. However, in a nutshell it will provision an Ubuntu VM for us to use.

Save this as `Vagrantfile`.

```ruby
# https://app.vagrantup.com/bento/boxes/ubuntu-20.04
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-20.04"
end
```

Create, login, update.

```bash
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

## Provisioning

We can view available channels with `snap info microk8s`. At the time of writing, k8s 1.21 is the most recent. Let's use that.

```bash
snap install microk8s --classic --channel=1.21/stable
microk8s.status --wait-ready

mkdir -p /home/vagrant/.kube
microk8s config > /home/vagrant/.kube/config

usermod -a -G microk8s vagrant
chown -f -R vagrant /home/vagrant/.kube
```

Logout, and log back in. Let's verify we can use k8s.

```bash
microk8s kubetl get nodes
microk8s kubetl get all --all-namespaces
```

Sweet! We are in business! That was refreshingly simple.

## Add-Ons

Staying true to the name, microk8s is truly quite slim. The default install doesn't come with basics like DNS or a default storage class. We can install them with [add ons](https://microk8s.io/docs/addons).

```bash
microk8s enable dns storage
```

The first will make a [coredns](https://github.com/coredns/coredns) deployment. The second will make a hostpath provisioner deployment.

There's definitely more! Click through to the linked add-ons documentation if you're curious.

## Deploying

To wrap up this blog post, let's deploy a pod. In homage to canonical, we'll run ubuntu. We have a working setup.

```yaml
# save this as pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ubuntu
spec:
  containers:
    - name: ubuntu
      image: ubuntu:latest
      command: ['/bin/bash', '-c', '--']
      args: ['env | sort; while true; do sleep 30; done;']
```

```bash
microk8s kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
microk8s kubectl logs ubuntu
```

## More

In the spirit of automation, I have a `Vagrantfile` with a provisioner to set all this up in one shot, plus some extra goodies. Check it out [here](https://github.com/justinwalz/microk8s-vagrant).

# Next up

- Deploy microk8s on EC2.
- Deploy an app backed by postgres. We'll use the helm and ingress add-on.
- Configure ingress and cert-manager for painless https with letsencrypt.
- Deploy a monitoring stack, using prometheus, loki, and grafana.
