Lately, I've re-committed to a mindfulness practice. Life goes fast, and I've always tried to squeeze everything in as efficiently as possible. Like many others, this day-to-day rush has taken its toll on me.

This mindfulness practice helps me to slow down, to take better care of myself, and to listen to my mind and body. I run, I do yoga, or I simply sit, all of which are excellent opportunities for to engage with myself with no distractions, no screens, and no technology. Just me on the trail, the mat, or the ground. Simply hearing the sounds, smelling the smells, and feeling my surroundings.

What I want to share today is this, the most helpful tip I've heard so far. **Mindfulness begins with a pause.**

That is it. Just a pause. Not a position, not a style of breath, not a specific thought pattern. The beauty is the simplicity. It feels so natural, and it is unique to the person and situation.

Just pause, become aware, and tune into the senses. Stop hustling for a moment.

This certainly is not a new concept, however I found it extremely helpful... and I hope by sharing, it might help someone else too.
